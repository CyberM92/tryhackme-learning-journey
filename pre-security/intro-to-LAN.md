## üß† What I Learned
- Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies
	- Star Topology ( "...devices are inidividually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub.")
		+ Scalable
		- added cost (wiring and network equipment)
	- Bus Topology ("This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable.")
		+ easier and more cost-efficient
		- bottlenecking ("all data through same cable")
		- little redundancy in place in case of failures ("single point of failure along the backbone cable") 
	- Ring Topolgy (also known as token topolgy)
		+ little cabling required
		+ less dependence and dedicated hardware
		+ fairly easy troubleshooting 
		+ less prone to bottlenecks
		- not efficient to send data across network in a circle
		- one faulty cable/device will result in the entire network breaking 
- What a switch is/does
- What a router is/does

## üí° Key Takeaways
- There are different LAN topologies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses 
- Switches are more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters)
- Routers connect networks and pass data between them
