## üß† What I Learned
- **Port Forwarding**
	- Opens specific ports on a **router** to expose internal services (e.g. web server) to the internet
	- Allows external devices to access services running behind NAT/firewalls

- **Firewalls 101**
	- Operate at OSI **Layer 3 (Network)** and **Layer 4 (Transport)**
	- **Stateful firewall**: inspects full connections
	- **Stateless firewall**: inspects individual packets only

- **Practical Firewall Configuration**
	- Lab scenario: block attacker IP from accessing web server port 80
	- Result: flag earned once the firewall rule is correctly applied
	- Flag: `THM{FIREWALLS_RULE}`

- **VPN Basics**
	- Understanding VPN technologies:
		+ **PPP** ‚Äì encrypts and authenticates data only  
		+ **PPTP** ‚Äì uses PPP but provides weaker encryption  
		+ **IPSec** ‚Äì uses IP framework for encryption and authentication
	- Q&A:
		+ PPP encrypts/authenticates data  
		+ IPSec leverages IP-based architecture

- **LAN Networking Devices**
	- **Router** ‚Äî performs **routing**
	- **Switches** ‚Äî operate at **Layer‚ÄØ2 and Layer‚ÄØ3**
	- Q&A:
		+ Router‚Äôs verb = *routing*  
		+ Switch layers = Layer‚ÄØ2, Layer‚ÄØ3

- **Network Simulator ‚Äì Practical**
	- Simulated packet journey from computer‚ÄØ1 to computer‚ÄØ3
	- log shows handshake steps (5 entries) and final delivery
	- Flag from simulator: `THM{YOU‚ÄôVE_GOT_DATA}`
	- Handshake count: **5**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- TryHackMe interactive simulation environment (web-based)
- Internal firewall configuration UI
- Network simulation GUI showing packet logs

## üí° Key Takeaways
- Port forwarding is essential for exposing internal services to external networks
- Firewalls and their behavior (stateful vs stateless) impact how traffic is filtered
- VPN technologies offer varying levels of encryption and authentication
- Understanding core LAN devices and their OSI operation layers helps clarify network architecture
- Visual packet logs reinforce understanding of routing, ARP, and TCP handshake mechanics
